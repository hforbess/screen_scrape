A possibly useful example of phantomJS usage. 
Screen scrapes a wholesale merchandise site. Retrieves the categories and category urls then uses that info to retrieve products info and urls in that category.

The site in question http://eastwindgifts.com provides this to resellers but not in a categorized way. I use their info in conjunctcion with what I scraped to store in a db for easy manipulation.
